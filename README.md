# hp-literature

This project was developed for the HuPan literature during the University

此项目为大学期间的湖畔文学社而开发.

## 构思（conception）
- first of all, from when I was in college, had wanted to give us the idea of literature to build a website, but suffer from a student's helpless pain, many ideas have been put on hold, but for this matter, "if you have a dream, you must go to defend his" ——from "the pursuit of happyness"

- 首先，从我上大学的时候，就有过想给我们文学社建一个自己的网站的想法，但是苦于学生时代的苦逼，很多的想法都被搁置了，但是一直为此事耿耿于怀，"如果你有一个梦想，你必须去捍卫他"——来自《当幸福来敲门》

- coincidentally, two years after working, I was exposed to the word "open source," and I saw a lot of open source writers who were trying to contribute to open source.So I learned from them, and I made some open source ideas.A person's time and energy is limited, I can not be in the work, at the same time to realize two ideas, so I have to combine them.This is -- be a web site for the literary community and open source!

- 巧的是，在工作两年后的今天，我接触到了“开源”这个词，我看到了很多的开源作者都在努力的为开源奉献着。于是乎，我又有了向他们学习，自己也做点开源的想法。一个人的时间精力都是有限的，我不可能在工作之余，同时又去实现两个想法，所以我得将他们结合起来。这就是————为文学社做一个网站，并且开源！
## 设计(design)

- This two days in to design problem, because it is the first time a person alone to do a complete project, some problems also lack of consideration, must first complete design, then I will upload the document
- 这两天在着手设计的问题，由于是第一次一个人单独做一个完整的项目，有些问题还欠缺考虑，得要先进行完整的设计，届时我会把涉及文档一并上传
